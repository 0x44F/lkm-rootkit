# Linux rootkit
Linux kernel rootkit, indev and currently pretty unstable but working. Use only for **ethical** purposes, do not play with this stuff on
your main system, please know what you are doing and don't try to play with fire or you will be burned.

### Includes
This repository includes the rootkit itself and a module (example.c) that allows you to execute instructions as root very easily.
Remember to always use these things with care.

## Use cases
Use this in order to test your system security, or to remotely administrate a system. Written as ethical malware for fun. Write for fun, not
for profit!
